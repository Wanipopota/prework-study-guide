        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications.</li> 
          <li>HTML documents are composed of elements, which are defined by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and typically come in pairs: opening tags and closing tags.</li>
          <li>The head section typically contains metadata such as the document's title, links to external stylesheets or scripts, and other essential information for the browser.</li>
          <li>The body section contains the content of the web page, including text, images, multimedia, and other elements.</li>
          <li>HTML introduced semantic elements like header, nav, main, section, article, footer, etc., which provide meaning and structure to the content.</li>
          <li>HTML supports ordered lists (ol), unordered lists (ul), and definition lists (dl) for organizing and presenting information in a structured manner.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It defines how elements should be displayed on a web page.</li>
          <li>CSS properties define the visual appearance of HTML elements. They include attributes such as color, font size, margin, padding, border, background, and more.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS properties are assigned values that determine their specific appearance. Values can be keywords, numerical values (e.g., pixels, percentages), colors, or other units of measurement.</li>
          <li>A set of CSS properties and their values enclosed within curly braces ({ }) is called a declaration block. Multiple declaration blocks can be applied to a single selector.</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: command to commit all files in the working branch.</li>
          <li>git commit -m “<>”: to associate a message with our commit.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.</li>
        <li>Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, variables can be declared using keywords like "var", "let", or "const", and can hold various types of data, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and functions.</li>
        <li>JavaScript supports various data types, including primitive types such as numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, as well as complex types like objects, arrays, and functions.</li>
        <li>Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript supports arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), assignment operators (=), comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==), logical operators (&&, ||, !), and more.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.</li>
        <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
